## 📝 **YOUR CO-FOUNDER PITCH:**

### **Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**

"I've built MeatHub - a hyperlocal meat marketplace connecting customers with trusted local butchers. Think Uber for meat delivery, but with transparency and subscriptions.

I'm a full-stack developer - I've already built 3 complete portals (customer, admin, butcher) with React and Spring Boot microservices. The technical foundation is done.

I'm looking for a business co-founder who can handle sales, operations, and getting our first customers. Someone who can turn this code into a real business.

Interested in building this together?"

## 💰 **EQUITY SPLIT RECOMMENDATIONS:**

### **Standard Split: 50/50** ⭐ Recommended

**You get:** 50% (for building the entire technical foundation)
**Co-founder gets:** 50% (for building the business)

**Why this works:**
- Fair to both sides
- You built the MVP, they'll scale it
- Both are equally important

### **Alternative: 60/40**

**You get:** 60% (if you've done significantly more work)
**Co-founder gets:** 40% (if they're joining later)

**Use this if:**
- MVP is very complete
- You have some early traction
- Co-founder is less experienced

### **Vesting Schedule:** (CRITICAL!)

**Both co-founders should have 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff:**
- Year 1: 25% vests
- Years 2-4: Monthly vesting (2.08% per month)

**This protects both of you if someone leaves early**
