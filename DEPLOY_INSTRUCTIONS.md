# 🚀 DEPLOY MEATHUB LANDING PAGE - FOLLOW THESE STEPS

## ✅ **THE PAGE IS OPEN IN YOUR BROWSER!**

I just opened the Vercel one-click deploy page for you.

---

## 📋 **WHAT TO DO NOW (4 SIMPLE STEPS):**

### **Step 1: Login to Vercel**

On the page that opened, you'll see:
- "Create Git Repository"
- Login options

**Click:** "Continue with GitHub" (recommended)
- This will link your GitHub account
- You may need to authorize Vercel

---

### **Step 2: Configure Repository**

You'll see a form with:
- **Repository Name:** `meathub` (or `meathub-landing`)
- **Project Name:** `meathub-landing`
- **Root Directory:** `landing-page` ✅ (should be pre-filled)

**Leave everything as default** - it's already configured correctly!

---

### **Step 3: Click "Deploy"**

Just click the big blue "Deploy" button!

Vercel will:
- Clone your repository
- Build the landing page (instant - it's just HTML)
- Deploy to their CDN
- Give you a live URL

**This takes about 30-60 seconds!**

---

### **Step 4: Get Your URL**

After deployment completes, you'll see:
```
🎉 Congratulations!

Your project is live at:
https://meathub-landing.vercel.app
```

**Copy this URL** - this is your live landing page!

---
