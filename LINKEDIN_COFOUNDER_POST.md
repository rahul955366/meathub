🚀 Seeking Business Co-Founder for Food-Tech Startup

After 6 months of development, I've built MeatHub - a hyperlocal meat marketplace platform that's technically complete and ready to scale.

THE OPPORTUNITY:
India's ₹40,000 crore meat market lacks transparency and convenience. MeatHub solves this by connecting customers directly with trusted local butchers through subscriptions and on-demand delivery.

WHAT'S BUILT:
• Multi-portal architecture (Customer, Admin, Butcher)
• Microservices backend (Spring Boot, MySQL)
• Modern React frontends with TypeScript
• AI-powered recommendations
• Subscription management system
• Complete working MVP

WHAT I NEED:
A business co-founder to:
• Acquire first customers and butcher partnerships
• Drive sales & marketing
• Manage operations & logistics
• Scale from 0 to revenue
• Build the business while I handle the tech

THE DEAL:
• 50/50 equity split (negotiable)
• Full-time commitment
• Clear role separation (Tech vs Business)
• Target: ₹50 lakh+ revenue in Year 1

IDEAL CANDIDATE:
→ Business development or sales background
→ Food industry connections (bonus)
→ E-commerce or marketplace experience
→ Startup hustle mentality
→ Based in India

This is a real opportunity to build something meaningful. The technical foundation is strong. Now we need to take it to market.

Interested? Let's connect.

## 📱 **POST VERSION 3 (Story-Driven):**

```
📖 6 months ago, I started building MeatHub - a platform to make meat buying transparent and convenient.

Today, I have:
✅ 997 files of code on GitHub
✅ Three complete web applications
✅ Eight microservices
✅ A working platform ready to launch

But I've realized something: I'm a builder, not a seller.

I can build any feature you can dream of. But I need someone who can:
• Get our first 10 customers
• Convince butchers to partner
• Run marketing campaigns
• Manage operations
• Scale this from 0 to 1

That's where you come in.

I'm looking for a business co-founder who gets excited about:
→ Building relationships with local businesses
→ Solving logistics puzzles
→ Growing revenue from zero
→ Creating impact in a ₹40,000 crore market

What I offer:
• Complete technical platform (no outsourcing needed)
• 50/50 partnership
• Clear role split (you = business, me = tech)
• Opportunity to build something real

If you're tired of thinking about starting something and actually want to DO it, let's talk.

The platform is ready. The market is there. We just need to execute.

Are you in?
